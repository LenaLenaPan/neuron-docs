# NeuronEX + InfluxDB

InfluxDB is an open-source time-series database designed specifically for storing and processing time-series data. It is a high-performance, scalable, and easy-to-use database that can handle large amounts of real-time data, and provides powerful querying, aggregation, and visualization capabilities.

The design goal of InfluxDB is to optimize the handling of time-series data and can handle real-time data types such as sensor data, monitoring data, and log data. It supports high-concurrency writes and queries, and provides a variety of flexible query methods such as SQL-like queries, InfluxQL query language, Flux query language, etc., allowing users to choose the most suitable query method as needed. In addition, InfluxDB also provides some built-in visualization tools such as Grafana to help users easily create beautiful graphs.

## Data Visualization

InfluxDB provides some built-in visualization tools such as Grafana to help users easily create beautiful graphs and dashboards. Data collected by NeuronEX can be processed graphically through InfluxDB.

## High Performance

InfluxDB is specifically designed for time-series data and can quickly write, query, and aggregate data. It uses various optimization techniques such as indexing and sharding to improve data access speed and availability. The combination of NeuronEX and InfluxDB ensures the accuracy and real-time nature of data collection.

## Flexibility

InfluxDB supports multiple data querying and aggregation functions, which can help users analyze and process device data collected by NeuronEX from multiple dimensions.
