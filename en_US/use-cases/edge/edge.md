# Edge Processing

Edge processing with Neuron and eKuiper allows for data processing and analysis at the edge of the network, closer to the data source. This significantly reduces the latency associated with sending data to a centralized cloud for processing. Real-time insights and actions can be derived more quickly, enabling faster response times for critical applications.

By processing data at the edge, Neuron and eKuiper can filter and aggregate data before sending it to the cloud or central server. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network, optimizing bandwidth usage and reducing the costs associated with transmitting large volumes of data.

Leveraging Neuron as an industrial gateway and eKuiper as a stream processing engine for edge processing brings benefits such as reduced latency, optimized bandwidth usage, improved reliability, enhanced security and privacy.
