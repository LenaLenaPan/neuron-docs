# Neuron + eKuiper cooperation

As a light-weight stream processing engine, eKuiper can be deployed on the edge side near the data source to do real-time analysis and smart decisions.

## Integrate Data from Multiple Sources

eKuiper can provide flexible data interfacing capability for industrial sites, realize data pulling and integration of factory MES, ERP, database and various third-party applications, clean and process data through flow computing capability, and realize the interaction and collaboration between human-machine, material-law-loop in industrial sites with the ability of flow table combination. Neuron, an industrial protocol gateway software, integrates PLC, non-standard automation equipment, SCADA and various instruments in the factory for real-time data collection via edge message bus. At the same time, Neuron enables reverse control of plant equipment via MQTT and Restful API, and in combination with control optimization algorithms, enables low-latency data processing and analysis and production process optimization.

Through Neuron+eKuiper's efficient collection of multi-dimensional data, real-time data from machines and equipment in the factory, business data related to production and operation, product design and process data, and data from various production management software in the factory can be aggregated and analyzed to achieve production process optimization, reduce production loss, and improve production output.

## Edge-side AI Model Integration for Real-time Inference Decision

eKuiper can make full use of multi-dimensional data from industrial sites, absorb and precipitate manual experience, combine industrial mechanics knowledge and data statistics methods, use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to establish optimization models of equipment production processes, optimize and control production processes, make equipment operation more reliable and stable, and improve enterprise economic efficiency.

eKuiper supports calling Python scientific computing, machine learning and deep learning algorithm libraries and C/C++ algorithm models transferred from Matlab, and realizes real-time AI inference calculation at the edge by combining real-time data streams, and sends the inference results to the automation equipment side in real time through Neuron to realize real-time optimization and continuous optimization of the production process.

## Summary

The deep integration of new-generation information technology and manufacturing industry, through the comprehensive interconnection of people, machines and things, and the construction of a new industrial production, manufacturing and service system that fully connects the whole element, the whole industrial chain and the whole value chain are the core and key to support the fourth industrial revolution.

EMQ Cloud Edge Collaborative Industrial Internet Solution, which connects artificial intelligence and cloud computing technology to traditional industrial production, helps enterprises realize the collaboration of data flow, production flow and control flow, improve production efficiency, reduce production costs, and help factories realize digitalization, real-time and intelligent transformation.
