IEC 60870-5-104 supports communication between the control station and the substation through a standard TCP/IP network. The TCP protocol is used for connection secure data transmission. The standard interoperability list ensures the interoperability between devices from different vendors.

* IEC 60870-5-101: Serial
* IEC 60870-5-104: Ethernet
* IEC 61850: Ethernet
