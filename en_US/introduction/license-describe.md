# License Policy

Neuron is an open source project. We encourage our community to develop their own pluggable modules.

Core framework, dashboard, and a few plugin modules such as modbus-tcp, mqtt, and eKuiper are open source under LGPLv3 license. Neuron may run with these open source modules without an EMQ license. But all other commercial plugin modules require an official EMQ license to run without limitation. <!--can we add a table here to list the modules that need or need not a license to run?-->

A trial EMQ license can be downloaded from our [official website](https://www.emqx.com/en/apply-licenses/neuron). All available modules could be used with a limitation of 100 connections and 1000 data tags for 15 days. If the trial EMQ license is expired, you can apply for the trial EMQ license via our official website again. Please note that each mailbox is limited to two trial license applications.

Of course, you can also directly [contact us](https://www.emqx.com/en/contact?product=neuron) to obtain the official license.
