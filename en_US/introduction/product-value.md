# Product Value

In fields such as industrial automation, IoT, and energy management, large amounts of data need to be collected, processed, and analyzed. However, different devices use different communication protocols, making it difficult to implement functions such as data collection, monitoring, and control. To solve this problem, Neuron can connect to multiple devices using different protocols, collect data from multiple devices in real-time, and upload data to the cloud in real-time. Neuron realizes the interconnection between the industrial IoT platform and various devices.

In addition to real-time data collection, monitoring, and device control, Neuron combined with the data stream processing engine eKuiper can also perform data processing, analysis, and storage. Neuron has the following advantages:

## Solution
Neuron is an industrial IoT connection solution that can meet the requirements of multiple data collection and operation use cases for both discrete and process manufacturers.

## Improve Data Processing Efficiency

In industrial data collection, different devices use different communication protocols, so protocol conversion is often required during data collection. Neuron can collect data from devices using different protocols and upload the data to various cloud or IIoT platform applications via MQTT. The use of Neuron eliminates the tedious operations during data collection and processing, improving data processing efficiency and accuracy.

## Reduce System Integration Complexity

In fields such as industrial automation, multiple devices and systems need to be integrated to achieve functions such as data collection, monitoring, and control. Due to different devices and systems using different communication protocols, complex protocol conversion is often required during system integration. Neuron can run on different hardware architectures such as X86 and ARM and can achieve data collection at the level of 100 milliseconds or even 10 milliseconds on limited hardware resources. The use of Neuron reduces the cost and difficulty of system integration, improving the efficiency and reliability of system integration.

## Data Storage

Combined with the use of the data stream processing engine eKuiper, Neuron can store data in the InfluxDB database. The data can be used for analysis and processing.
