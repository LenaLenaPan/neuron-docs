# DL/T645-2007

## Module Description

DL/T645-1997 refers to a technical standard used in China for electronic energy meters. It is also known as "Communication Protocol of Electronic Energy Meters." This standard specifies the communication protocol and data format for the exchange of information between electronic energy meters and data collection systems.

DL/T645-1997 defines the structure of data frames, the content of data fields, and the communication methods to be used for transmitting energy consumption and other related information. It covers various aspects such as meter reading, load control, event recording, and parameter setting.

The standard provides a common framework for communication between energy meters and utility companies or other entities involved in energy monitoring and management. It enables accurate and efficient data collection, billing, and analysis of energy usage.

It's worth noting that the DL/T645-1997 standard is relatively old, as it was published in 1997. There might be more recent versions or successor standards that have been introduced since then to keep up with advancements in technology and address emerging requirements.

The DL/T645-1997 plugin supports serial port connections and transparent TCP connections.

## Parameter Configuration

### Serival

| Parameter                 | Description                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connection Timeout**    | Timeout for sending requests to the device          |
| **Send Interval**         | read instruction interval(ms)                       |
| **Serial Device**         | Use a serial device, e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0             |
| **Stop Bits**             | stopbits, default 1                                 |
| **Parity**                | parity bit, default 2, which means even parity      |
| **Baud Rate**             | baudrate, default 9600                              |
| **Data Bits**             | bytesize, default 8                                 |

### TCP

| Parameter                 | Description         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Connection Timeout**    | Timeout for sending requests to the device    |
| **Send Interval**         | read instruction interval(ms)                       |
| **IP Address**            | When neuron is used as a client, host means the ip of the remote device. When used as a server, it means the ip used by neuron locally, and 0.0.0.0 can be filled in by default    |
| **Port**                  | When neuron is used as client, port means the tcp port of the remote device. When used as a server, it means the tcp port used by neuron locally     |
| **Connection Mode**       | The way the driver connects to the device, the default is client, which means that the neuron driver is used as the client       |

## Supported data types

* UINT32
* UINT64

## Usage of Address Format

### Address format

> mail_address#DI<sub>1</sub>-DI<sub>0</sub> </span>

* mail_address represents the mailing address of the meter.
* DI<sub>1</sub>-DI<sub>0</sub> represents the data identification, and all points only support read attributes, and expressed in hexadecimal.

E.g 123456789012#B6-11, represents the value of the A-phase voltage of the meter device with the mailing address 123456789012.

:::tip
Support a node to configure multiple mailing addresses, that is a single serial port multi-device connection.

Please refer to the DL/T645-1997 industry standard data coding table for the specific data item name corresponding to the data identifier.

* For data lengths up to 4, select UINT32 as the data type.
* For data lengths up to 8, select UINT64 as the data type.
* Set the value of **Decimal** according to the data format, e.g, if the data format is XXX.X, then **Decimal** is set to 0.1.
